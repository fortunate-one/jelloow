# Michael's Notes

## 09-25-2023

Met with Stijn and reviewed current state. Looks like things are relatively on track. I requested some more clarity on fields and testing data as well as lists of agencies and brands. I started adding my technical notes to the `Data Structured` page on notion to provide input on data formats and scraping techniques.

Checked linkedin API, it is still giving an unauthorized so I will wait until another chance to get a de-bugging session with Jolien / Stijn

Worked on adding more comments to fields.

Tested out yfinance and initially found that the python package does not have revenue. I need to find out if you can actually pull revenue from the API or if I need to use a different source or scrape from the yahoo website.

Working on understanding fields and how to scrape them

## 09-29-2023

Talked with Stijn and got some feedback about the fields. Also it looks like the architecture / structure of the scraper looks good and I can continue with it. I am still waiting on credentials to connect to document DB and relational DB. Also, looks like Linked in API is still getting 403 error.
